Recent studies have shown that nucleolar grade alone is sufficient to define grades 1 to 3 for clear cell and papillary RCC and that this provides outcome prediction superior to that of Fuhrman grading. In these studies, grade was based upon the single high power field showing the highest grade (52, 53). These observations have been validated in independent survival studies (54, 55). There was also an agreement that the presence of rhabdoid or sarcomatoid morphology within any of the morphotypes of renal cell carcinoma represents a form of tumor dedifferentiation. The prognosis of these tumors is similar to that associated with presence of extreme nuclear pleomorphism or tumor giant cells (56, 57). These combined observations were incorporated into a novel grading classification for renal cell carcinoma to be known as ISUP Grading Classification for renal cell carcinoma (Table 1) (58).">
